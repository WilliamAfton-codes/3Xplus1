3x+1 - The Collatz conjecture, an infamous unsolved mathematical conjecture

# What is 3x+1?
According to Wikipedia, the Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. Informative video from Veritaseum [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg)

If a number is odd, the number is multiplied by 3, and then one is added. However, if the number is even, it is halved.

This script aims to automate the sequence, by allowing you to input a number and watch it follow the rules of 3x+1

# Usage
Make sure you have Python installed before usage

Download the script from [releases](https://github.com/WilliamAfton-codes/3Xplus1/releases) and run

Input an integer (Can be positive _or_ negative, but negative numbers may break)

The script will generate the sequence using your seed, and if the sequence stops at 1, the Collatz conjecture is true (For that number).

# Notes
Thanks for downloading 3Xplus1, this script is just a gimmick, and while it does work, I don't recommend trying to solve the Collatz conjecture
